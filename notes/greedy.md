# Greedy Algorithms

Example:

You are the banker in Monopoly with your family who has lost many of the game pieces so you only have bills in these denominations: 

- $5
- $10
- $25 

You need only pay out your family in the least number of bills possible so you don't run out before the game is over. Write a function that calculates the least number of bills required for any given dollar amount that is divisible by 5.
