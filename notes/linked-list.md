# Linked List

Linked List is made of a bunch of nodes that point to the next one in the list.

Every node has two or more properties, namely the value and a pointer to the next node in the list.

These nodes will NOT be sequential in memory, meaning we don't get the easy lookups, but the advantage here is that adding things will be easy since we don't have to do shifting or collapsing as we do with ArrayList.

The Big O for lookups will be O(n).

Where are Linked Lists  useful? Any time you need to do lookups, insertions and deletions. The Big O for insertions and deletions will be O(1).
