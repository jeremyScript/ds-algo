# Time Complexity

How much primitive operations are  executed?

- with respect to input size
- and assuming worst case scenarios.

## Time Complexities
- constant O(1)
- logarithmic O(log n)
- linear O(n)
- quadratic O(<sup>2</sup>)
- exponential O(k<sup>n</sup>)

## Common Complexity Operations
- O(1)	Running a statement
- O(1)	Value look-up on an array, object, variable
- O(logn)	Loop that cuts problem in half every iteration
- O(n)	Looping through the values of an array
- O(n<sup>2</sup>)	Double nested loops
- O(n<sup>3</sup>)	Triple nested loops
