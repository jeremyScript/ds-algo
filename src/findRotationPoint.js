/*
Given an array of words that are alphabetically ordered except the start of the
list of words is not at the very top or at index 0.

For example:

  const words = [
  'ptolemaic',
  'retrograde',
  'supplant',
  'undulate',
  'xenoepist',
  'asymptote',  // <-- rotates here!
  'babka',
  'banoffee',
  'engender',
  'karpatka',
  'othellolagkage',
];

Write a function for finding the index of the "rotation point", which is where
the start of the list is. Assume the list is huge so we want efficiency here.
*/

// Solution

/**
 * @name findRotationPoint
 * @param {array} words - An array of words in a rotated, alphabetical order.
 * @reutrns {number} The index at which the list of words rotates.
 */

export const findRotationPoint = (words) => {};
