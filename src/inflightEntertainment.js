/*
Write a function that takes an integer flightLength (in minutes) and an array of
integers movieLengths (in minutes) and returns a boolean indicating whether
there are two numbers in movieLengths whose sum equals flightLength.

When building your function:
- Assume your users will watch exactly two movies
- Don't make your users watch the same movie twice
- Optimize for runtime over memory

 * @param {array} movieLengths - An array of movie runtimes in minutes.
 * @param {number} flightLength - An integer for flight duration in minutes.
 * @returns {boolean} A boolean indicating whether two such films exist.
