/*
Write a function that takes an array of multiple meeting time ranges and returns
an array of condensed ranges.

For example, given:
[
  { startTime: 0,  endTime: 1 },
  { startTime: 3,  endTime: 5 },
  { startTime: 4,  endTime: 8 },
  { startTime: 10, endTime: 12 },
  { startTime: 9,  endTime: 10 },
]
the function would return:
[
  { startTime: 0, endTime: 1 },
  { startTime: 3, endTime: 8 },
  { startTime: 9, endTime: 12 },
]

Do not assume the meetings are in order. The meeting times are coming from
multiple teams.

Write a solution that's efficient even when we can't put a nice upper bound on
the numbers representing our time ranges.
