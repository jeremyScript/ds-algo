/*
You want to build a word cloud, an infographic where the size of a word
corresponds to how often it appears in the body of text.

Write code that takes a long string and builds its word cloud data in a
Map, where the keys are words and the values are the number of times the words
occurred.

Assume the input will only contain words and standard capitalization and
punctuation. Your code should reasonably handle the same word with different
capitalization.

// Solution

const buildWordCloudData = (str) => {};
